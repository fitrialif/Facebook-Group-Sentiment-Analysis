The ordering setup was a little reminiscent of Chipotle, but the food was quite the opposite. The 48 hour slow-cooked short rib is one of the best pieces of meat I've ever eaten. Just pay the difference for the larger $20 portion size (you won't regret it). The short rib was so tender and flavorful, especially with the amazing hoisin demi-glace. The whipped potatoes were was fluffy as could be. I also tried the smoked chicken pastrami sandwich with a side of the daily soup, which was a salmon chowder. The salmon chowder was great and better than the sandwich itself. But, back to the short rib - don't consider ordering anything else. The concept of a fast casual restaurant is interesting.

I'm going to try and figure out how they made that puree and replicate it. It was THAT good. Presentation for this meal was also great. I had a bite of the bf's sirloin and the sauce used on that with the potatoes was also quite flavorful. Price for meals of this standard are very reasonable in my opinion given that at a full sit down restaurant these entrees would go for closer to $20.Service was quick and friendly, they're happy to help explain anything on their menu and the process behind how they make it. \u00a0This place is doing something unique in the Denver scene in my opinion.

(Mmmmmmmmm, waffles. :D ) I am teetering between 4 and 5 stars for here...*drums fingers* [WARNING: This review turned out to be a novel!]Showed up here on a chilly day this week after a 12hr+ fasting blood draw. \u00a0I was hungry, it was lunchtime, and Los Parceros was close to my doc's office, and looked intriguing, so I stopped in there. *Completely* filled that day. \"Screw this\", I thought, \"there are puh-LENTY of quality establishments along E Colfax\". \u00a0Spun the Yelp App Wheel O Randomness...and up came Chop Shop; highly averaged at the nirvanic lofty heights of 4.5 stars. My course was set.Shortly thereafter wandered in and actually stumbled into the line of people who'd gone in and lined up correctly along the wall. \u00a0Oooooooops. I was greeted warmly by the friendly order taker there and she brushed my faux pas aside with a warm smile and re-emphasized they were CAZH-U-ULL there. \u00a0Message received, thanks! I pondered the boards and was leaning towards the chicken masala, but wasn't quite there; then the next party that came in and I brushed them ahead since they had a game plan, 1 of them ordered the masala -- so that made my 1st course set in concrete. \u00a0I briefly thought about the chop salad, but I'm a firm believer that weather and ESPECIALLY chilly weather alters one's appetite -- and I can tell you for an unshakeable FACT I look at (cold lettuce-based) salads in the winter like they are alien; just like I look at 7-cheese mac and cheese and spare ribs dripping with fat in the summer like, \"I see why people think you're hot, and I do too -- but...not until the 1st snowfall\". \u00a0Cyclical appetites...I sat down at the narrow table-for-2 since I didn't want to take up space at any larger tables, a slightly darker and shadowier booth along the outside wall. \u00a0I soon had my masala brought to me -- and it was not what I expected. \u00a0NOTE: I am NOT saying that as a bad thing, it was just...different...like the last time you saw a friend and they had blonde hair, and you see them a week later and suddenly they're sporting purple. \u00a0If you do a Google search on \"chicken tandoori masala\", THAT's what I was expecting (and probably, subconsciously, hoping for on a chilly day -- something with some Indian spice to it). \u00a0That was not the case...This dish is not on their website menu unfortunately, so I'm going to wing it on the ingredients...[but I will enclose some photos]: sliced chicken, sitting on top of (I believe) a tasteful bed of lentils, topped with mango bits, SOMETHING green in the mix, little red bits, and a container of cilantro yogurt to drizzle over the creation. \u00a0How was it? It...was not what I expected. \u00a0BUT...it was very very tasty, flavorful and -- I don't know. \u00a0The flavors did not *blend* well, maybe, to me -- but each layer stood out more on its own. \u00a0And that was unique and very pleasing to the palate -- all the ingredients \"get along\" together, maybe they just don't blend? (Except the cilantro yogurt; that blended with everything). \u00a0Please don' t think I didn't care for it; I did -- just a note to others if you are expecting an Indian-esque spiced dish: that is not this. \u00a0Be prepared for an urban spin on a classic.I was still hungry afterwards (maybe a result of the 12+ hr fasting?), and my tummy was signaling \"Not full, buddy. \u00a0Good thing you ordered...\"...the banana cream creme brulee. \u00a0In contrast to the masala dish, this brulee WAS pretty much what I expected: served in a small iron dish, it looked like a brulee -- and *wow*, was that HEAVENLY. It's definitely creme brulee. \u00a0And it's got banana saturating it; from the taste of the soft smooth custardy insides under the caramelized crust, to the sliced bananas and whipped cream on top drizzled with ...I don't know, and it doesn't matter -- it's just a wonderful, decadent dessert to be savored, bite by bite, holding it in your mouth and letting your tastebuds register the awesomeness that is going on.I was approached in the middle of each course by (a? the?) manager, Shannie(?) who was very friendly and wanted to make sure I was very pleased with the taste and appearance of each dish, and I was. \u00a0The fact that I'm writing a damn novel about this place should vouch that I was very pleased. \u00a0I just haven't been out a lot over the last 3-6 months tbh, and was it a 5 star experience? ...I don't know. 4, for sure. \u00a0I guess if I'm questioning it, it should be a 4. \u00a0*This* time.But there's always next time. \u00a0There were enough tantalizing options on the menu -- plus those Moscow Mules during Happy Hour at some point for $4 a piece (btw: the strange word in the middle of that recipe, when you see it on the boards, is not some flavor additive or liquid; it's actually an exotic fruit. \u00a0Wish I could remember the name of it, it's about 10 letters long) -- plus another warm, savory date with Le Creme Brulee guarantees that's gonna happen. \u00a0Thanks CS for a great 1st XP, and thank *you* for reading!"}, "model": "facebook_sentiment_analysis.yelpreview", "pk": "K1hskp9CF1JxFK4947pfug"}, {"fields": {"star": 5.0, "review_text": "This place was awesome.

The food is above and beyond what you would expect and while it is served quickly, that does not in anyway mean it is lacking in any way whatsoever.For dinner, we decided to share the large (there is a large and small portion) of the 48 Hour Slow-Cooked Short Rib which came with grilled baby carrots, whipped potatoes, and 3-peppercorn hoisin demi glace. This dish was amazing!! The meat was tender and the flavor outstanding!! This was definitely my favorite dish!!! Not a bit was left. The other dish we ordered was the Pan Roasted Pork Tenderloin in a Szechuan Marinade with roasted butternut squash puree, sauteed brussel sprouts, and yuzu & dried cherry chutney and five spice jus. Whew! That's a lot. And it was also incredibly good!!! Very tender and flavorful. I am just not a huge squash fan and the short rib really just was amazing. While we didn't have it, the special was a Bacon-Wrapped Meatloaf and I heard another table just raving about it. So I think the biggest thing to realize is that you are paying what you get for - so this is not an inexpensive dining experience. Our two dishes, a beer, and 8 oz glass of wine were $54 (I added tip as well). The price definitely matches the quality but this is probably not where you would go for a quick, cheap meal. The service was excellent, the restaurant clean and overall just a great experience. The burgers and sandwiches that passed us by on top of our amazing meal only cemented my decision to return and I look forward to it!!"}, "model": "facebook_sentiment_analysis.yelpreview", "pk": "epIkk5GVsmfQX0Jl1k5KAA"}, {"fields": {"star": 5.0, "review_text": "OMG.

The storefront is very unpretentious, but inside you definitely have the same kind of post-industrial feel that many spots we were at around the city do. It gives this spot a trendy feeling even if they are serving fast casual food. I was impressed by the menu, which doesn't stick to just one type of palate but instead spans the world. While I stuck with the traditional on our nation's birthday and got a burger, my wife got the tandoori chicken masala - a bold choice from a spot that didn't have any clear inclination towards Indian food, but the chicken was really good - very moist and tender, with a lot of flavor without being overly spicy (in fact, I'd say it could have used a tad bit more). As for my burger, it was perfectly cooked, although the meat itself didn't stand out as much some of the other burgers I've had. That said, I did like the spicy aioli that topped it, and for being someone who was long averse to cheese on his burger, I found the slice of American to be very good - definitely not your Kraft thin-slices from the grocery store. I subbed out my fries for an order of mashed potatoes, which were just a tad on the buttery side (I wish there were more chives instead!) but was very well-executed nonetheless.You order your food at the front like a typical fast-food spot, but you sit down at a booth or at the barstools lining the window and have your food brought out to you. The serving of the food is a bit 'fun' as well; both of our meals were served on cutting (chopping?) boards...a nice little play on the restaurant's theme. It's a very relaxing meal, with tunes blasting in the background while you get your grub on.

So a few nights ago I decided to take a walk and have my first meal at Chop Shop. I went with the pork chop, my friend with the burger. Being happy hour (everyday from 3pm-6pm) I ordered a margarita for $5, it was so tasty that I had another, I just wish it could have been a tiny bit more stiff. They also have a moscow mule for $4 and some happy hour food items that I shall try in the future, because yes, I will be definitely back. Here is why...my plate, or board arrived and I was stoked already, what great plating! \u00a0A terrine of sorts was my dish, spicy broccoli rapini, roasted mushrooms, and a nice sized and very well seasoned pork chop, all atop a nice bed of tasty mashed potatoes. A small saucer comes on the plate with what was called 'Chop Shop A-57' in it, so good my friend asked to have some for his burger. Which by the way, he called a 'very tasty burger'. I had heard things about the portions being small, but this was a good amount of food. Just imagine if everything on the plate were beside one another instead of stacked, it's just an illusion-a delicious one! I really enjoyed the service here as well, nice and genuine, prompt, not in your face but also not elusive. If you come here with a large group, you may want to call ahead, the space is small. The patio gives additional room, but only for weather permitting times. Take out is available and you can even order online, and they have an app for your phone as well. How cool!?!

We arrived right around happy hour, so I made sure to order some things from that menu, while my cousin and best friend ordered from the regular menu. I had the spiced blood orange margarita, rib niblets, and the tempura platter (all from HH menu - great deal!) The margarita was delicious, I'm picky about Margs, but this is one to try! Beautiful drink when served, and tastes even better! The rib niblets were so yummy, fell right off the bone and was covered in a delicious hoisin-ish sauce. That came with a side of southwestern cole slaw that was also really good, not your typical cole slaw by any means...black beans, corn, and a little kick at the end. The tempura platter was also great; avocado, pickle, zucchini and tofu all tempura fried with a dipping sauce. Great choice for the vegetarians out there! I also ordered a bowl of the soup of the day, it was some kind of pumpkin bisque, sorry for not remembering the name, but it was delicious. Velvety and rich with a side of toast.My cousin had the cheeseburger, it was pretty basic. Good cheeseburger but try to venture out if you are here! Due to many reviews on yelp my best friend Kendell tried the chicken pastrami sandwich...chop shop...I salute you. The reviews are absolutely right, this sandwich is amazing - and still tasted bomb when I ate the other half late night straight out of the fridge.Great atmosphere as well.

Cons:-The Name/Brand. I remember the amazing food and design, but I keep calling it the Chop House or the Chopped Salad. -Potential customer confusion due to mix of casual and upscale (you stand in line, order at a counter and seat yourself, yet the menu selection, food presentation and quality of food and service states \"I'm anything but casual\")......And do you tip the food runners? I did because not only did he bring our food and bus the tables, he knew his product well enough to answer my questions about the food. (Elevate's Ketchup with cinnamon -does it really exist?)

These dishes are masterfully crafted, the attention to detail in terms of presentation and taste is top notch bistro quality. Except, you literally get your food in a flash and it's inexpensive for the quality you get. I mean I knew the concept before I came because of reviews, but it still took me by surprise. The soups were great, the salads were interesting and delicious with tons of flavor and textures, the sandwiches were incredible. This is a place you can have drinks with friends, get take out, or bring the kids to. It's multi functional!!

Having considered trying it for a few weeks, we finally took the plunge and tried it. I didn't know what to expect-- and was happy to find that it's a fast-casual place with counter ordering and table service.My husband got the burger-- which was simple and delicious. It was served with house chips (taro root chips?) and was cooked nicely, moist and flavorful. Definitely one of the better burgers we've tasted in a while. I got the Iceberg Chop with crispy tofu and it was very good. The tofu was flavorful, crisp and just what I wanted. The blue cheese in the salad was a little overwhelming and the salad was nothing amazing (that's what i get for ordering iceberg!) but a big portion for the price.We were happy to see the restaurant fill up as we had our lunch, and we'll definitely be back."}, "model": "facebook_sentiment_analysis.yelpreview", "pk": "HRiPdoCdn3TjYrmf1pU6lA"}, {"fields": {"star": 4.0, "review_text": "In town on work and found Chop House through Yelp and decided to give it a shot. \u00a0Glad I did! \u00a0Unique concept, casual atmosphere, and great food. \u00a0I had the salmon and a side salad. \u00a0Plan on going back before I head back home. \u00a0I would've given 5 stars, but my portion of salmon was on the kind of small."}, "model": "facebook_sentiment_analysis.yelpreview", "pk": "qxG_tJx0EPQvKNs-r4xQlA"}, {"fields": {"star": 5.0, "review_text": "This place is a great quick and tasty option for families!

We were cruising down Colfax and this place had caught my eye a few days prior. I looked at yelp and the reviews sealed the deal on our decision. It was a rainy and chilly night and this place hit the spot! We received a great meal, that was freshly cooked, and delivered to our table very quickly. Based on prior reviews, I ordered the flank steak which was so tender that it fell apart without a knife and a party of seasoning flavors in my mouth..it was delicious!! Husband really liked it to and he tends to be less adventurous with flavors and veggies. Hubs ordered the French dip which was...amazing! He is not a horseradish fan, so he ordered the aoli on the side, but he ate ever last drop of it..totally made the sandwich and was not super strong as some horseradish items can be. The house made chips were the only thing that was slightly underwhelming, but we did not need them anyways. We also saw a lot of people coming in to pick up carry out orders. This is going to a regular spot for us.

I'm not a hater. When something deserves good marks, I spread the word near and far. The menu has the makings of something great. My daughter chose buttered noodles (how hard is this to get right?) and refused to eat them after one bite. \u00a0I tried one and agreed that it was better to remain hungry. The fruit that was served with her noodles was too ripe and soggy. She normally loves fruit and stopped eating that after one bite too. I had the hamburger which should have been delicious.
